# 🛡️ Smart Helmet Safety System

An IoT-based safety solution using Arduino for motorcycles that ensures:
- Mandatory helmet usage
- Alcohol detection
- Accident detection and GPS alert

## 🧠 Features
- Helmet status check using limit switch
- MQ-3 alcohol sensor to prevent drunk driving
- ADXL345 accelerometer for accident detection
- GPS location tracking via NEO-6M module
- Emergency alert sent via ESP8266 WiFi to cloud/contacts

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution
As a Computer Science student, I developed the complete Arduino code to integrate all sensors and implement the safety logic.

## 🧾 Files Included
- `smart_helmet.ino` – Arduino source code
- `Smart_Helmet_Project_Report.docx` – Full technical report

## 📈 Performance (from testing)
- Helmet detection: 99.5% accuracy
- Alcohol detection: 98.8%
- Accident detection: 97.6%
- Alert system: 99.2% uptime
